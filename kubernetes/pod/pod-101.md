A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes and represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. A Pod definition is a YAML or JSON configuration file that describes the desired state of the Pod, including the containers it runs, their resources, ports, volumes, and other configurations.

# Components of a Pod Definition:
    apiVersion: Specifies the Kubernetes API version.
    kind: Defines the type of object (e.g., Pod, Deployment).
    metadata: Contains metadata about the Pod (name, labels, etc.).
    spec: Describes the desired state of the Pod, such as the containers it should run.
